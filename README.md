# AST54-Weighted-Dice
a Dice roll Ggate sequencer with five outputs and a "chaotic" OR output. a potentiometer controls the roll speed. a 1 means gate 1 is on, a 2 means gate 1+2 are on, a 3 means gate 1+2+3 are on, a 4 means gate  1+2+3+4 are on, and a 5 means 1+2+3+4+5 are on. This is useful as an On at 1 is always guaranteed, with probability decreasing on the higher  numbers/creating "dependable" events with quasi aleatoric events. 
is activated by a button or can be hardwired by conencting 5V to pin 13.

the OR output at pin 7 can be made by connecting the each output to pins 9-12 computaitonally but badly sampling the outs for added inderminacy.
